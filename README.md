## Task 2: The Amy | AGE Study to Investigate Beta Amyloid Accumulation

A study, named the **amylAGE study**, has been carried out involving **100 individuals** with suspected **Alzheimer's Disease (AD)** to investigate the impact of age (in years) on **amyloid beta protein concentrations**.

### Objectives
The study conductors now aim to:
- Gain a better understanding of what to expect across a wider range of ages.
- Explore models for describing the trend in the dataset.
- Carry out predictions for amyloid beta levels at ages **75 to 110** years old.

### Recommendations
What recommendations can you provide based on your findings?
